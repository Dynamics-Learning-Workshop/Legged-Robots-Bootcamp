The goal is to move the pendulum from 0 to pi/2 rad in 1.5 sec and then back to 0 in 1.5 sec. We use a third order polynomial. This is done in onelink_traj.m\
\
1. Set parms.m1_hat = parms.m1; and parms.control.Kp1 = 0;\
\
Run the file onelink_main.m\
Note that the RMSE errors for position and velocity are almost zero.\
\
2. Set parms.m1_hat = parms.m1+0.5; keeping Kp1 as it is.\
\
Run the file onelink_main.m\
Note that the pendulum swings wildly not following the intended path. \
\
3. Set parms.control.Kp1 = 100\
\
Run the file onlink_main.m \
Note that the RMSE error is slightly lower than 2. \
\
Keep increasing Kp1 and see how the RMSE error decreases.\
\
Controller designed choose the lowest possible Kp1 such that the RMSE error is below an acceptable value. This acceptable value is a design spec.}
